# TMDB

The TMDB endpoints provide access to movie and TV show metadata from The Movie Database (TMDB), including detailed information about content, ratings, and regional streaming provider availability.

## Features

- **Intelligent Metadata Lookup**: Accepts both TMDB and TVDB GUIDs for flexible content identification
- **Regional Streaming Data**: Get watch provider information for different countries/regions
- **Comprehensive Metadata**: Access detailed information including overview, ratings, cast, and production details
- **Multiple Content Types**: Support for both movies and TV shows

## Regional Support

TMDB endpoints support regional filtering for streaming provider data. Use the `region` query parameter with a 2-letter country code (ISO 3166-1) to get region-specific watch provider information.

## Authentication

All TMDB endpoints require a valid TMDB API key to be configured in the application settings.
